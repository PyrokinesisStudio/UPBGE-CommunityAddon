=====================================================
The Community Addon is a framework for UPBGE. It adds features and fixes bugs that are yet to be patched in UPBGE, and it provides a new and easy to use hight level Python API.

For your convenience we have divided the documentation in two blocks: Blender UI, wich are elements that requiere no coding knowloadge, and Python API, wich is a new API that you can use to further customize behaviour.
