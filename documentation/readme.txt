You can get the documentation online at: http://coredoc.royalwebhosting.net/

To generate/update the documentation you need the following dependences (linux only):

Python3 (Not BGE-Python, but the original): https://www.python.org/downloads/
Sphinx: "pip install sphinx" or http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html
Graphviz: http://www.graphviz.org/ (Maybe)

Make sure that Python(Python3) and Dot (Graphviz) are on the system path or can be executed form anywhere in the system command line.

You can make the documentation executing "make" on this directory from the terminal or executing the"make.bat" file on Windows. Use "make clean" if you want to remake.
