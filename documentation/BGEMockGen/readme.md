## BGE API Mock AutoGen Tool

This tool will take the html output of your API generated with Sphinx and
uploated to a server and convert it to a Python Readable API to use with
code editors and IDEs.

The tool has been designed for BGE, UPBGE and Core APIs, but with little to
no modifications it may be able to compile any Sphinx generated API.

To generate the api, run "make.bat" or "python make.py"
